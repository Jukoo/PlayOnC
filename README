============
Play On C
============

This is just a simple  repository  that i use to play  with C  programming  (yeah i'm a big fan ).
Just playing around  it and try to reproduce some built-in C functionalities not prefect as you expected but   i'll do my best.
having fun and  also  make some practice and learn new things about low level programming  ...

I 'm open for any proposal  from anybody  

Cheers!!
